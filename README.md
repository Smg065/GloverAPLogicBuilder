# GloverAPLogicBuilder
 A helper program for Archipelago to map Glover N64 logic

Made by Smg065 in Godot

THIS IS NOT READY FOR USE.
This version is for peer review of check names, suggestions, proofreading for errors, and to communally decide on garib groups.
DO NOT begin work on building checks using .glapl files yet, as the checks are subject to change and that effort could be wasted, or worse, the old .glapl files could corrupt.
