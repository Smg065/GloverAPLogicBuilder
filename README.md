# GloverAPLogicBuilder
 A helper program for Archipelago to map Glover N64 logic

THIS IS ALMOST READY FOR USE.
This version is for peer review of check names, suggestions, proofreading for errors, and to communally decide on garib groups.
You can start working on Glover AP Logic, but be prepared to manually edit your .json file if it becomes out of date. When it's fully implimented it should be safe to build with no risk of file regression.
